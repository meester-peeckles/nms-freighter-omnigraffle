Stencil and template for OmniGraffle for freighter layouts in No Man's Sky

There are two main files, a stencil (No Man's Sky Freighter Rooms.gstencil) and a template (No Man's Sky Freighter Layout.gtemplate) for use in [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/). These can be used to create floorplans of your freighter in the game [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com).

Just open the files in OmniGraffle and follow the instructions on installing.

The stencil contains all the buildable rooms available in a freighter. The template contains a grid into which you can drag the rooms. The template has multiple layers:

* Main Floor (Bridge): This layer is the main/default floor for new freighters. While the default layout has more rooms, this layer contains three rooms, colored in red, to indicate the three rooms that must be there at a minimum. They cannot be deleted.

* Freighter Floor: You can use this layer for additional floors above the first one. If you need more floors, you can copy this layer as needed. There are no fixed rooms for these floors.

* Separator: This layer is a semi-transparent separator for use between floors. You can use this as a way of fading out floors below the one you are working on, allowing you to see rooms below yours without getting in the way. For instance, you can use this to make sure stairs match up between floors.

Also included is an example file (Default Freighter Layout.graffle). It shows the default freighter layout when you first acquire it.
